  <h2>📌 Description</h2>
  <p><strong>War of Kingdoms</strong> is a simple strategy game where players control different kingdoms and attempt to conquer each other's territories. The game is built in Java and focuses on object-oriented principles, such as inheritance and polymorphism, to handle the game mechanics and interactions between kingdoms and units.</p>
